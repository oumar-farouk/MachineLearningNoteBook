# MachineLearningNoteBook

+ This notebook will walk you through machine learning algorithms.
+ It will permit you to lead machine learning project starting data cleaning to model building and export.
+ You will be able to choose a machine learning algorithm such as random forest, SVM,CART,etc to train your model and find best parameters.
